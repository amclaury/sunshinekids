"Honestly, the inability to use my hands to express myself was the hardest part. I love, love, love to draw, and now cancer had taken that away too. Hadn't it already taken enough? Was it not yet satisfied?" After 43+ weeks of a cocktail of chemotherapy and 6 weeks of radiation, Titi was pronounced cancer-free on November 22, 2016 at the age of 14. After an 11 month "prison sentence," she was finally free. Titi has always been cheerful, but on that day her smile shined brighter than even the sun itself.

On July 10, 2015, I was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) a week before I was supposed to travel to my softball world series in Ocean City, MD. At first this all came to me as a shock, I had no idea what "Leukemia" was and I was upset when I started seeing comments on social media saying I had cancer. I thought they were lying and I was frustrated because I thought the doctors weren&apos;t telling me everything, but they came in a little later and told me Leukemia was a type of blood cancer. While my team was at the tournament, I was stuck in the hospital for the next 18 days.</p>

The last thing I had on my mind was that it could be cancer. That's something you only hear in movies and read in books. It is certainly not something you expect to happen to you.</p>

I started chemotherapy right away. After a few weeks of treatment, my doctor told us that it wasn&apos;t working and that I had to undergo a Bone Marrow Transplant; an infusion of new bone marrow after they wiped out my own in order to make me healthy. In June that year I received a transplant and it worked! I recovered quickly and was able to return to school in January that following year, for my 6th grade year. Three years later, in February 2014, I relapsed; my cancer had returned. This time I didn&apos;t undergo chemotherapy as long and I received a second Bone Marrow Transplant that May. I wasn&apos;t able to return to school until a year later, in May 2015.</p>
