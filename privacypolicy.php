          <p>
          	The Sunshine Kids Foundation appreciates our donor’s support and respects their privacy. The Sunshine Kids Foundation does not sell or trade any donor information. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the correct use of information, The Sunshine Kids Foundation has in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information received from donors. The credit card and personal information provided by the donor is used only to process the donation or fulfill a request for information and will not be disclosed, sold, traded, rented or otherwise revealed to the personnel of the Sunshine Kids Foundation or any third party without the consent of the donor.	
          </p>
          <p>
          	If a donor does not wish to receive communications from The Sunshine Kids Foundation, the donor may opt to remove their name from the Foundation mailing list. For legal and accounting purposes, donor records will remain in the organization database, but the donor will no longer receive mailings from The Sunshine Kids Foundation. To exercise this option, the donor should send their request by letter or email to the Sunshine Kids Foundation. 
          </p>
          <h2>TYPES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED</h2>
          <h3>Information You Provide</h3>
          <p>
            The Sunshine Kids Foundation may gather personal information, which is information that is linked to a specific, identifiable individual (such as, but not limited to, first and last names, home addresses, e-mail addresses, phone numbers) (&quot;Personal Information&quot;). If the Site offers an account or personal profile, we may require that you supply us with Personal Information to set up such an account. We may also collect payment information if you make a transaction, such as a donation. And, we may collect other information about you, such as demographic information (e.g., your age or gender), and information about your preferences and interests. If we combine demographic or other non-Personal Information with Personal Information, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.
          </p>
          <h3>Information We Collect Automatically As You Access and Use the Site</h3>
          <p>
            We and our third-party service providers (including any third-party content, advertising, and analytics providers) may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect certain information about your use of the Site whenever you visit or interact with the Site (&quot;Usage Information&quot;). Usage Information may include the browser and operating system you are using, the URL or advertisement that referred you to our Site, the search terms you entered into a search engine that led you to our Site, all of the areas within our Site that you visit, and the time of day you visit the Site, among other information. Usage Information also includes the IP address, mobile device identifier, or other unique identifier (&quot;Device Identifier&quot;) for any computer, mobile phone, or other device used to access the Site. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your device and our servers identify your device by its Device Identifier.
          </p>
          <p>
          We may use Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including enhancing or otherwise improving the Site and our services, and to target content or offers to users. The Usage Information we collect is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we will treat it as Personal Information.
          Cookies and Local Storage
          &quot;Cookies&quot; and local storage are pieces of information (data files) transferred to an individual’s browser on their device when the device is used to visit a site.

Like most Internet sites, the The Sunshine Kids Foundation Site uses these technologies for a variety of purposes. For example, we use these technologies to serve targeted advertising elsewhere online, to track the total number of visitors to our site on an anonymous, aggregate basis, and to remember you when you return to the Site and remember your preferences. We may associate Personal Information with a data file. You can find more information about cookies and how they work at AllAboutCookies.org.

            Web Beacons. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as &quot;pixel tags,&quot; &quot;1x1 GIFs,&quot; or &quot;clear GIFs&quot;) may be included in our web pages and email messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or email can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Site, to monitor how users navigate the Site, to count how many emails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular links were actually viewed.

          In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies that collect similar information for security and fraud detection purposes.
          </p>
          <h3>Information Third Parties Provide About You</h3>
          <p>
          We may receive information about you from third parties and we may supplement the information we collect with outside records in order to provide you with information, activities or services you have requested, to tailor content, to offer you opportunities to become involved in activities that we believe may interest you, and for other purposes. We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect through the Site. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information.
          </p>

          <h2>SECURITY AND PAYMENT PROCESSING</h2>
          <p>
          We employ commercially reasonable security methods and technologies to help secure the Personal Information we collect and store. Donor information is stored within a donor management database within The Sunshine Kids Foundation. Access to the database is restricted to personnel with a legitimate business need to access or modify the information contained therein. However, no system can be guaranteed 100% secure. We therefore cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us, or that we transmit to you, or guarantee that it will be free from unauthorized access by third parties.
          </p>
          <h2>INFORMATION SHARING</h2>
          <p>We may share non-Personal Information, such as Usage Information and aggregated user statistics, with third parties in our discretion. The Sunshine Kids Foundation does not sell or share personal information with unaffiliated third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We may share the information we have collected about you (including Personal Information): (i) as disclosed at the time you provide your information, (ii) with your consent, (iii) as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, or (iv) in the following circumstances:
          </p>
          <h3>Third Parties Providing Services on Our Behalf</h3>
          <p>
          Companies may be engaged by The Sunshine Kids Foundation to perform a variety of functions, such as assisting with donation collection, providing technical services for our Internet sites, etc. Such companies may have access to Personal Information if needed to perform certain functions. However, these companies may use such Personal Information only for the purpose of performing that function and may not use it for any other purpose.
